            <h2>What is Kindtrust?</h2>
            <p class="lead">KindTrust is a decentralized crowdfunding platform built using a Solidity smart contract that is deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. Users can analyze, donate to, and rate crowdfunding projects. Organizations can create projects and transfer donated funds to registered suppliers. Everything is decentralized, which produces five major benefits over traditional crowdfunding platforms. </p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Transparency:</b> Organizations' expenditures are recorded transparently and permanently in the blockchain. There is no other way for the Ether to be released to the supplier.</li>
              <li><b>Decentralization:</b> Organizations are not dependent on any central authority, so their projects cannot be blocked or delisted.</li>
              <li><b>Data:</b> All data is public, meaning organizations can easily export their projects and ratings. They can control their data.</li>
              <li><b>Fees:</b> Fees are significantly less compared to centralized platforms. Only standard Ethereum gas prices are paid.</li>
              <li><b>Universality:</b> Unbanked people can start projects, expanding the reach of traditional crowdfunding platforms.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Stack</h2>
            <p class="lead">On the backend there is a Solidity smart contract that maintains state for organizations, crowdfunding projects, suppliers, purchases, donors, and the platform itself (e.g. total money donated). Images and long descriptions are stored on IPFS, and their corresponding hashes are stored in the blockchain. </p>

 <p class="lead">The frontend consists of mobile apps that integrate with the backend via web3 and IPFS.

            <h2>Future Roadmap</h2>
            	<ul>
            		<li> <b>Database:</b> The solidity contract fires events. We can set up an Express.js server that will listen to these events from a contract instance. This can be done with—instance.eventName({fromBlock: 0, toBlock: ‘latest’}).watch(callback);—where the callback would record information from the event into a database. It is much easier and cheaper to filter or sort (e.g. by category or time) using a database. </li>
					<li> <b>Machine learning:</b> Along the same lines of which projects to show first, incorporate machine learning. We can use a nearest neighbors classifier to score how likely a donor would donate to a given crowdfunding project based on previous donations. This can help to increase the platform’s impact. </li>
					<li> <b>More ratings:</b> Donors who have donated can rate a project based on the percent of spent funds the donor judges to have been spent effectively (0-100%). We will add more rating systems (organizations rate suppliers, suppliers rate organizations, etc.). </li>
					<li> <b>Arbitration:</b> Use arbitration (similar to eBay) to help prevent fraud. The system is that funds will be sent to an Escrow contract, and then two out of three stakeholders (organization, supplier, arbiter) will have to vote to either release the funds to the supplier (goods were received) or refund the funds to the organization (goods were not received or were damaged). </li>
					<li> <b>Currency conversion:</b> Since this was implemented as a decentralized application (dApp), donors can only donate with Ether. There are many ways to obtain Ether (e.g. with Coinbase), but allowing donors to donate with fiat currencies would increase the platform’s impact. </li>
